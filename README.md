# kibibyte-pipboy

Just a hobby project to build something like the PIPBOY from Fallout

A lot of the things can be improved here but I started this project as one of those mid-night motivation last year and went halfway through then completely forgot about it.

[Demo](https://purplecandy.github.io/kibibyte-pipboy/)

## CLI Commands

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
